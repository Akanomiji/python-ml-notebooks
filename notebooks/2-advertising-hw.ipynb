    "To illustrate principles of linear regression, we are going to use some data from the textbook “An Introduction to Statistical Learning withApplications in R” (Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani) (available via NYU Library).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose that we are statistical consultants hired by a client to provide advice on how to improve sales of a particular product. The `Advertising` data set consists of the sales of that product in 200 different markets, along with advertising budgets for the product in each of those markets for three different media: TV, radio, and newspaper.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> …\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It is not possible for our client to directly increase sales of the product. On the other hand, they can control the advertising expenditure in each of the three media. Therefore, if we determine that there is an association between advertising and sales, then we can instruct our client to adjust advertising budgets, thereby indirectly increasing sales. In other words, our goal is to develop an accurate model that can be used to predict sales on the basis of the three media budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sales are reported in thousands of units, and TV, radio, and newspaper budgets, are reported in thousands of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will fit a linear regression model to a small dataset. You will iteratively improve your linear regression model by examining the residuals at each stage, in order to identify problems with the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our multiple linear regression includes additive effects of all three types of advertising media. However, it does not include *interaction* effects, in which combining different types of advertising media together results in a bigger boost in sales than just the additive effect of the individual media.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern in the residuals plots from parts (1) through (3) suggest that a model including an interaction effect may explain sales data better than a model including additive effects. Add four columns to each data frame (`train` and `test`):\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `newspaper` $\\times$ `radio` (name this column `newspaper_radio`)\n",
    "-   `TV` $\\times$ `radio` (name this column `TV_radio`)\n",
    "-   `newspaper` $\\times$ `TV` (name this column `newspaper_TV`)\n",
    "-   `newspaper` $\\times$ `radio` $\\times$ `TV` (name this column `newspaper_radio_TV`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you can use the `assign` function in `pandas` ([documentation here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html)) to create a new column and assign a value to it using operations on other columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, train a linear regression model on all seven features: the three types of ad budgets, and the four interaction effects. Repeat the analysis of part (3) for the model including interaction effects. Are the interaction effects helpful for explaining the effect of ads on product sales? Are there any patterns evident in the residual plots that suggest further opportunities for improving the model?\n",
